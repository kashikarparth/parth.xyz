the combination of clear thought, and aggressive execution is what leads to a fulfilling daily experience. lately, I have been thinking about the true potential of decision making in probabilistic, subjective spaces, and how one can maximise the signal from all the noise present today.

clarity gives you

- direction - to "know" you're doing the "right" thing (both subjective), even if immediate circumstances indicate otherwise, is a sense of inner peace
- leadership - problem solvers are, in essence, truth seekers. your clarity of thinking makes you a value addition in others shaping and sharpening their own.
- compounding - on of the strongest levers in modern economics is developed through perseverance. agency without clarity is untapped potential.
- reconciliation - any worthwhile pursuit has challenges and rough phases. clarity allows you to push through it, without much confusion about the decisions you are making along the way.

moreover, we are either thinking clearly, or not. both realities are lived through. we don't really have a choice on _what_, but to maximise this approach of _how_ to live. there is not going to be a one size fits all solution, because we are a product of nature and nurture, both varying vastly across different geographies, cultures, financial statuses, genetic predispositions and so on. most clear thinking is truth seeking about _oneself_, and then scaled outwards to create an impact on the _world_.

people may refer to this as first principles thinking, and I'd say that this is a partial truth. the problem with such a stance, is that it is an illusion of reality. the concept of "first principles thinking", although a holy grail in sciences, does not apply to fundamentally [irrational humans](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/256472-madness-is-something-rare-in-individuals-but-in-groups) beyond the individual. we are driven by emotions, stories, motivations, fears, aspirations, and so much more beyond the mathematical truths behind our lives.

this is increasingly relevant in an increasingly smaller world, but the model of a clear thinker's world needs to include all the aspects of life that matter. first principles are an incomplete guide.
