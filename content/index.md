# hello üëãüèº

i'm parth

- engineering graduate from [bits pilani](https://www.google.com/search?q=bits+pilani&oq=bits+pilani&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), pilani, 2021. üéì
- previously tech lead at [regie.ai](https://www.regie.ai/), making ai agents for sales. üè¢
- currently exploring projects, wannabe writer üíª

this is my personal notepad, where i will be writing about everything i learn. tech, health, philosophy, everything everywhere all at once.

## superconcepts

the idea of superconcepts is of ideas that go beyond themselves (a.k.a. higher order thinking). [what can you learn from the last video-game you played](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15sd324/til_vitalik_buterin_created_ethereum_as_a_result/), and use at your current job? [what sort of concepts reverts themselves](https://einzelganger.co/the-backwards-law/), when pursued deeply (or broadly) enough? [how much distillation leads to oversimplification](https://x.com/paraschopra/status/1732368031714845094)? superconcepts are unlocked with obsessive knowledge hunting and introspection, usually through experience or deliberate effort.

there's an ocean of patterns out there just waiting to be explored. this is my tiny droplet of an effort.

## why write a blog?

the purpose of this blog is to record, at intentionally low bandwidth, my lessons and thoughts.

i've been meaning to write for a while now, because i believe that writing is one of the best ways to truly "realise" something. there are a few base concepts that have inspired me to begin writing.

1. this quote by [feynman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8414-what-i-cannot-create-i-do-not-understand)

   writing is slow and arduous, and it takes a lot of practice to get better. considering that i am a software engineer with the majority of my time spent coding, writing is a skill that i need to constantly sharpen because it translates directly into clarity of thought. writing forces me to think harder about the concepts i'm trying to explore, original or otherwise.

2. from patterns emerge superpowers

   i am going to tag everything. this is going to be a mess, but my hope is that patterns will emerge over time, which will make me reflect on myself and where i need to focus my energy and time. taking inspiration from concepts like [second brain](https://obsidian.md/) editors, but not to overcomplicate [doing things](https://x.com/ChrisWillx/status/1664302375656357888), i think this blog is a good way to start.

3. volume is king

   writing creates a sense of momentum and accountability. the hope is that writing will make me read and focus on more valuable information from the bloat that is the internet. [action produces information](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html), and writing can be a vehicle of action, adding a layer of meaning to the information i deal with.

## standards

- will write about tech, life, everything i want to explore.
- will have uncooked opinions, better to start feedback loops early than never.
- mostly text based, decoration is for short attention spans and pop psychology.
- dark mode because i like my eyesight. light mode for when i need to focus.
